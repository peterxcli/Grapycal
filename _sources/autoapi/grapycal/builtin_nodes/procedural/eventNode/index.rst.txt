   .. py:method:: build_node()

      Create attributes, ports, and controls here.

      Note: 
          This method will not be called when the object is being restored. The child objects will be restored automatically instead of
      running this method again.


   .. py:method:: init()

      This method is called after the node is built and its ports and controls are created. Use this method if you want to do something after
      the node is built.
